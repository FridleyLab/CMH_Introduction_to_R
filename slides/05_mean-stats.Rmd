## T-test
 
A t-test is a method used to determine if there 
is a significant difference between the means 
of two groups based on a sample of data.

The test relies on a set of assumptions for it
to be interpreted properly and with validity.
Among these assumptions, the data must be randomly
sampled from the population of interest and 
that the data variables follow a normal
distribution.


---
class: no-logo

## T-test assumptions

1. The data are continuous (not discrete).

2. The data follow the normal probability distribution.

3. The variances of the two populations are equal. (If not, the Aspin-Welch Unequal-Variance test is used.)

4. The two samples are independent. There is no relationship between the individuals in one sample as compared to the other (as there is in the paired t-test). 

5. Both samples are simple random samples from their respective populations. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample.

## T-test formula

Test Statistic (equal variances):

 
$T  = \frac{\overline{x}_{1} - \overline{x}_{2}}{S_{p}\sqrt(1/N_{1} + 1/N_{2})}$ 

where:
$S^{2}_{p}$ = $\frac{(N_{1}-1)s^{2}_{1} + (N_{1}-1)s^{2}_{1}}{N_{1}+N_{2}-2}$

## T-test visulize boxplots

The gene *MME* is a common marker for pre-B ALL. It is also known as CD10.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]

```{r t2boxplots, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
  
ggplot(target_p2 , aes(gender, MME, fill = gender))  +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual( values = c("yellow", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "MME expression" , x = "Gender", y = "expression")  

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "t2boxplots", echo = FALSE}
```
]
]

## T-test Visualize data Histograms

```{r t2hist, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
  ggplot(target_p2, aes(x=MME, fill=gender)) +

  geom_histogram( alpha=0.6, position="identity")
 
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "t2hist", echo = FALSE}
```
]
]

---
class: no-logo

## T-test R call

```{r comment=NA}

 
t.test( MME ~ gender, data = target_p2,
        alternative = c("two.sided"))

## Mann Whitney U Test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) 

 
A popular non-parametric test to compare outcomes between two independent groups is the Mann Whitney U test. The Mann Whitney U test, sometimes called the Mann Whitney Wilcoxon Test or the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, is used to test whether two samples are likely to derive from the same population (i.e., that the two populations have the same shape). 

It can also be used on related samples or matched samples to assess whether their population mean ranks differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test). It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student's t-test when the distribution of the difference between two samples' means cannot be assumed to be normally distributed. This is the case with our TPM gene expression values.

## Wilcoxon test: Histograms
  
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "wilcoxonhists", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[R Code]

```{r wilcoxonhists, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
mplot <- ggplot(target_p2 %>% filter(gender == "male"), 
                aes(x = NOTCH1 )) +
  geom_histogram(  colour = "black", position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Males") 

wplot <- ggplot(target_p2  %>% filter(gender == "female"), 
                aes(x = NOTCH1)) +
  geom_histogram(  colour= "black", position = "dodge")  +
  ggtitle("Females") 
  
grid.arrange(mplot,wplot, ncol=2) 
 

```

## Wilcoxon test visulize boxplots gender
  
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]


```{r wilcoxonboxplots, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
  
ggplot(target_p2 , aes(gender, NOTCH1, fill = gender))  +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual( values = c("yellow", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "NOTCH1 expression" , x = "Gender", y = "expression")  

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "wilcoxonboxplots", echo = FALSE}
```
]
]

---
class: no-logo

## Wilcoxon test gender
```{r comment=NA}
 
 wilcox.test(NOTCH1 ~ gender, data = target_p2,
                   alternative = c("two.sided"))
 
 
```

The p-value isn't below the 0.05 threshold, therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference to accept the alternative that there is a difference.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

 
Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is performed to assess if means are different between groups (can be more than 2 groups). The anova is performed on a formula which describes a continuous measure and a categorical variable (think height by gender) that takes the form `continuous ~ categorical` just as the other tests before.

## ANOVA: Histograms
  
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "anovahists", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[R Code]

```{r anovahists, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
mplot <- ggplot(target_p2 %>% filter(gender == "male"), 
                aes(x = PAX5 )) +
  geom_histogram(  colour = "black", position = "dodge", bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Males") 

wplot <- ggplot(target_p2  %>% filter(gender == "female"), 
                aes(x = PAX5)) +
  geom_histogram(  colour= "black", position = "dodge", bins = 30)  +
  ggtitle("Females") 
  
grid.arrange(mplot,wplot, ncol=2) 
 

```
]

## ANOVA test visulize boxplots gender
  
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]


```{r anovaboxplots, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide"}
  
ggplot(target_p2 , aes(gender, PAX5, fill = gender))  +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual( values = c("yellow", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "PAX5 expression" , x = "Gender", y = "expression")  

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "anovaboxplots", echo = FALSE}
```
]
]

---
class: no-logo

## ANOVA test gender

```{r comment=NA}
 
pax5_anova = aov(PAX5 ~ gender, data = target_p2)
summary(pax5_anova) 
 
```

The p-value very small, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in PAX5 expression between our 2 groups (gender).
